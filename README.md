colour-scripts
=

Colour scripts made in Python for use in desktop threads and whatnot.

You can easily make your own shape and colour combination by editing any script.

The shapes are 12 by 12 and have one colour only.

The scripts might not look good with all fonts. In the previews I am using Terminus.
